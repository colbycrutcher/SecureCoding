 * Write the code for the stubbed out closeOutputFile method below.
 * 
 * To perform operations in this method, you will need to utilize the OutputFile
 * class from the open output file exercise on this exam.  A correctly working 
 * OutputFile.class file is included as part of the Eclipse project and also
 * exists in the same directory as this source file.  This means you have direct access to 
 * the features of that class (fields and methods).  You do not have to import the class to use it.
 * 
 * Check to see if the output file is open (you'll need to examine the appropriate field in the
 * OutputFile class).  If the file is open, do the following:
 * 
 * close the PrintStream (outputFile)
 * set the errorMsg field to null
 * set the PrintStream (outputFile) field to null
 * set the isOpen field to false
 *

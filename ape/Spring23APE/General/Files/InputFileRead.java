 * Write the code for the stubbed out read method below.
 * 
 * To perform operations in this method, you will need to utilize the InputFile
 * class from the open input file exercise on this exam.  A correctly working 
 * InputFile.class file is included as part of the Eclipse project and also
 * exists in the same directory as this source file.  This means you have direct access to 
 * the features of that class (fields and methods).  You do not have to import the class to use it.
 *
 * First check that the file is open via the InputFile class and its isOpen field.
 * If the file is not open, return the following string from the method:
 * 
 * File not open for reading
 * 
 * If the file is open, read from the file until you reach the end doing the following:
 * 
 * Build a string that contains the contents of file.  The file can contain integers, doubles, and 
 * strings.  If the current item is an integer, read it in and add it to your string but precede the 
 * integer value with the text below followed by the integer
 * 
 * Integer: <integer value goes here>
 * 
 * If the current item is a double, precede the value with the text below followed by the double
 * 
 * Double: <double value goes here>
 * 
 * If the item you are looking at was not an integer or double, it is a string, so add it to the
 * string you are building in a similar fashion
 * 
 * String: <string value goes here>
 * 
 * Note that after Integer:, Double:, and String:, there is a single space.
 * Also: Follow each value you read in with universal newline-- "\r\n" 
 * 
 * Utilize the methods from the Scanner class to determine the type of the current data.  Check the
 * API as necessary for the best methods to use.  It is CRITICAL that you utilize the methods in the
 * Scanner class to ensure your properly identify and read the data.
 * 
 * At the end of the method, return the string you built that contains the data from the file
 * formatted as specified above.

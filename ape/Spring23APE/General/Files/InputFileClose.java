 * Write the code for the stubbed out closeInputFile method below.
 * 
 * To perform operations in this method, you will need to utilize the InputFile
 * class from the open input file exercise on this exam.  A correctly working 
 * InputFile.class file is included as part of the Eclipse project and also
 * exists in the same directory as this source file.  This means you have direct access to 
 * the features of that class (fields and methods).  You do not have to import the class to use it.
 * 
 * Check to see if the input file is open via the InputFile class and its isOpen field.  If the
 * file is open do the following:
 * 
 *  close the Scanner field (inputFile) of the InputFile class
 *  set the Scanner field to null
 *  set the File field (file) to null
 *  set the errorMsg field to null
 *  set isOpen to false
 *  
 *  If the file is not open, assign the following string to errorMsg:
 *  
 *  attempt to close input file that is not open
